The project is intended to run on AWS Elastic MapReduce environment. Because of the current version of Debian running on EMR, the version of R and rmr2 required, the entire instance setup process is manual and very precarious.\n\nSetup process -\nThe instance is setup using a bootstrap process in which Squeeze release of R is installed and subsequent to that the dependencies and rmr2 are installed. The current versions can be seen in the bootstrap.sh script.\n\nSteps -\nThough I intend to call my R programs using EMR steps but currently I am unable to call the script files. I am using the EMR script runner called script-runner.jar. Unfortunately the error show that the shell script file could not be found. As a workaround, I am logging into the master node using SSH (Putty.exe) and running the R program.\n\nThe program outline goes like this -\n* Read the input files which has customer ID, dates and amount in 3 columns\n* Aggregate them by month for each customer and make time series\n* Determine stationarity of these timeseries and pick out the non-stationary ones\n* (not MR) Take each of the \"pick-out\" customers create pairs, N-to-N\n* For each pair determine correlation to see if they influence each other\n* Those showing positive strong correlation would be grouped together (currently missing)\n* Find sales prediction using auto ARIMA\n\nThe program is written in 2 parts -\n1. MR_Main.R - the main module with the program entry point\n2. MR_Custom_Functions - Collection of simple routines used\n       This includes a method which pulls out time series for a customer uses an MR function\n       \n",
